## How to run

Can create a user or business account if wanted, otherwise we have default account for each.
- User account: Username: user, Password: 123

- Business account: Username: BusinessUser, Password: 123

The difference between the two account:
- Business accounts cannot book services, however they can create them
- User accounts can book services, but they cannot create them 

Booking a service:
- Must be on a user account 
- Times must be between 9am and 9pm 
- There must not already be an order for that time slot 
- Needs valid credit card credentials: 16 digit number, 4 digit date (no /), name, 3 digit CVS
- If the order is complete, it should be available on your profile > orders. From there you can delete the order if wanted

Creating a service:
- Must be on a business account 
- Go to "View profile"
- From there you can click "add service" and put in the credentials necesarry 
- You can add multiple services, edit or delete any of them 

These are the main features, but there are many more to discover
