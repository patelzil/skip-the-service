#  Skip The Service Vision Statement

The SkipTheService will be used to allow homeowners to access any service in one convenient location.  Like the popular food delivery apps, SkipTheService will allow users to view selective service categories and read user reviews to find and book any service from beauty and wellness for men and women to home repairs and maintenance.

The app will be primarily designed for use by homeowners. It will allow them to search and book any home services that may be required. If a business offers a subscription service, the user will have an option to subscribe. With this, payment will be automatically withdrawn on a monthly basis. As well, after booking a service, the user is welcome to write a review and give a rating on the providers profile.

While scrolling through possible providers, the user will be able to see the star rating and the earliest date the provider is available. When a provider is booked, it will inform the user of when the service will be arriving and send the home location of the user to the service provider. The user will also be able to communicate with the service provider through a messenger feature and in the order description when booking the service. As well, users can cancel an order within a 24 hour notice.

The system will implement an account creation feature to allow users to easily store information to furthermore simplify their experience as well as ensuring their data stays secure. With this, users will be able to store their home location, payment information and allow them to favorite a service for easy access on their next booking.

We envision this system as a mobile app, but with a web page available within future releases.

We believe that our system will be a major improvement over current systems. Our system will give users a one stop shop for any service necessary, reducing the amount of time searching for the best fit provider. Since any service can sign up, the providers will not require an expensive website for users to find and book a service. This will reduce the overall cost for service providers and allow smaller businesses to reduce their upfront cost.

The system will be considered a success if it meets these three criteria. Firstly, after some use, most users prefer this system over their previously used system. Secondly, business profits increase directly due to this new system. Lastly, on average, the total time it would take a homeowner to find and book a service is dramatically reduced.
