  <h2>Patel, Zil</h2>
<p>The development of the application has taught me more than I could have learnt on my own. I have been able to develop my skills in SOLID principles and agile development. My appreciation for Test Driven Development has increased and even more it has made me appreciate the importance of communication within a team.</p>
<h2>Qiu, Zelin</h2>
<p>During this period of time, I learned a lot, such as building applications using many architectural patterns, using different testing methods at different stages of project construction, and effective communication among team members. In addition, I think the SOLID principle is the most helpful to me. Let me not deviate from the original design concept, even in the case of increased program functions or changes in requirements.</p>
<h2>Reynolds, Wesley</h2>
<p>After the development of SkipTheService some of the key takeaways that have made the development process much simpler than it could have been abstraction and creating a proper architecture. Abstraction has made it easier to add new features and increase overall development time. As for creating a proper project architecture, it has made it way easier to understand the project and my members features. Overall an great experience working on one of my larger projects with a team.</p>
<h2>Thomas, Joshua</h2>
<p>Throughout the duration of this project I further developed my skills both in programming
as well as team cooperation.  Proper android development is something that I believe will be 
important going forward with my career and principles such as SOLID will help me in this regard.
I am also very happy about learning the basics of static website generating with Ruby and Jekyll which
was used to make this website and had a lot of fun designing it.</p>
<h2>Wan Yue</h2>
<p>In the past few months of developing an application, I have experienced how knowledge from lectures applies in real life. I have learnt how to build an application with designed patterns and to start with separated features, as well as how to keep high quality code. The smells I made that violate SOLID principles have given me a much better understanding of how to following these principles. Moreover, communicating with and learning from group members is an extra knowledge that I get from this project.</p>
