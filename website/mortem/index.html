        <h2>It's dangerous to go alone. Here, take this.</h2>
        <p>
        We think this iteration went quite well overall, with a majority of our more complicated
        features and UI being developed in the past few weeks.  We believe that we were able to improve
        our planning for merging and colaboration a lot this iteration, instead of merging and comparing
        code only once or twice we merged as soon as we had something meaningfull and functional finished.
        This allowed us to be more aware of what other people were doing and really helped us as whole.
        </p><p>
        However we also ran into a decent amount of technical debt this iteration, espessially when it came
        to having to refactor the database and many methods since we werent always on the same page as to
        what our design and layout should be.  This comes down to our lack of proper planning at the very start
        of the project.  Looking back now we shouldve made flowcharts and planned our UI out better so that
        we all knew what the design plan was.
        </p><p>
        Another interesting thing of note (and something we believe we did quite well) was that the vast majority
        of our classes were under under 100 lines of code and, althought we had a lot of them, this speaks to good
        design of our classes to do one purpose and do it well.  There were afew exceptions to this, the database
        obviously was larger as well as some of the more complex UI pages but as a whole I think we did fairly
        well on this aspect.
        </p><p>
        In closing we all believe to have learned something valuble from this project, both with resepct to our
        individual skills as a programmer, and perhaps more importantly, as a member of a developemnt team.
