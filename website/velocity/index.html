            Through the developement of SkipTheService, we were generally very conservative with our estimates
            because we were not sure of our capabilities as a team. From iteration 1 to 2, we bumped up our time estimates
            but we also got a lot more done than expected. For iteration 3, there was still a lot we wanted to
            add to the application and we were confident in our abilities to complete most of them. Due to some
            issues related to Covid-19, we under-performed and had to push some features to a future iteration.
            Even with some issues, we were became more accurate with our estimation as time went on.
